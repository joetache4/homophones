# Homophones

This is a list of English homophones.

## Definition

Wiktionary [defines](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/homophone#Noun) a homophone as
1. a word which is pronounced the same as another word but differs in spelling *or* meaning *or* origin.
1. a letter or group of letters which are pronounced the same as another letter or group of letters.

This list uses the second definition, meaning two or more words are English homophones if and only if
1. they are English,
1. they sound the same, and
1. are spelled differently.

So, although *rose* (the flower) and *rose* (past tense of *rise*) are homophones according to the first definition, they are not according to the definition used in this list.

## Notes about this list
- This list assumes standard US pronunciation and spelling.
- This list is alphabetized within and between lines. Words are separated by a single space. Alternative spellings are separted with a slash.
  - Example: "*grade grayed/greyed*"
- Contractions are included.
- Some words appear in the list multiple times due to different pronunciations (e.g., *bow*, *we're*) or with weak homophones.
- Weak homophones appear at the end of the list and are marked with one of the following:

## TODO
- Filter out words that violate rules under "Excluded words" section. Particularly, jargon and obsolete words.
- Throw out currencies like *réis* and *birr*? Maybe add "foreign words" to blacklist.
- Allow single letters? Are they considered "words"?
