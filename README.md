# Homophones

This is a list of English homophones.

## Definition

The following criteria is used to determine if two or more words belong on this list. The words
1. are English,
1. are whole words,
1. have the same pronunciation,
1. have different meanings, *and*
1. have different spellings.

Note that the dictionary usually defines "homophone" as a word with the same pronunciation as another but with a different meaning *or* spelling. However, this definition is far too inclusive for the purposes of this list, and it would potentially require the inclusion of many words with insignificant alternative meanings.

## Notes about this list
- This list assumes standard US pronunciation and spelling.
- This list is alphabetized within and between lines. Words are separated by a single space. Alternative spellings are separated with a slash.
  - Example: "*grade grayed/greyed*"
- Contractions are included.
- Some words appear in the list multiple times due to different pronunciations (e.g., *bow*, *we're*) or with weak homophones.
- Weak homophones appear at the end of the list and are marked with one of the following:

<div align="center">

|Symbol |Weak Homophone Type |
| --- | :------------------- |
|\*   | cot-caught merger    |
|†    | whine-wine merger    |
|§    | other                |

## Excluded words
- **inflected forms if the base forms are already listed**
  - e.g., "*moats motes*" is excluded because "*moat mote*" is listed.
  - e.g., "*died dyed*" is excluded because "*die dye*" is listed.
- **alternative spellings by themselves**
  - e.g., "*gray/grey*"
- **words that differ only by capitalization**
  - e.g., "*August august*"
- **proper nouns**
  - e.g., *Jim*, *Sioux*, *Perl*, *Sirius*, *Seoul*
  - Exception: "*sundae Sunday*"
- **informal & slang**
  - e.g., *wee*, *lol*
- **obscure jargon**
  - e.g., *axil* (botany), *cere* (ornithology), *prase* (mineralogy)
- **obsolete words**
  - e.g., *fley*
- **acronyms & abbreviations**
  - e.g., *AIDS*, *Col.*
- **interjections**
  - e.g., *hi*, *whoa*, *oh*, *ho*, *uh*, *hey*
- **(names of) individual letters and their plurals**
  - e.g., *cee*, *J*, *q*, *rhos*
  - Exception: The singular of certain Greek letters are allowed because they have actual meaning in English (e.g., *pi*, which is a mathematical constant).
- **digits**
  - e.g., *1*, *2*, *2nd*, *4*, *4th*, *6*, *8*
  - Note: *one*, *two*, etc. ARE included.

## TODO
- Filter out words that violate rules under the "Excluded words" section. Particularly, jargon and obsolete words.
- Throw out currency names like *réis* and *birr*? Maybe add "foreign words" to the blacklist, if they're not already banned for not being English.
- Allow single letters? Are they considered "words"?
- Include homophones that are spelled the same?
